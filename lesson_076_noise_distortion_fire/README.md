# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 076 - Noise Distortion Fire
**Description**:
I never found a good tutorial that explained how to use distortion in shaders to create effects like fire. Thanks to MinionsArt and ciaccodavide on twitter posting some tips on how its done, I am able to finally play around and try to implement something that works in webgl and glsl. We explore the steps and different looks at each stage of putting the effect together.
