# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 043 - Ray to Plane Intersection
**Description**:
Continuing from creating a mouse ray cast, we can now learn how to use that ray and find where it intersects on a plane in 3d space. This is an important step since most intersection algorithms start with Ray to Plane before determining if there is a collision/intersection of the shape specific shape.
