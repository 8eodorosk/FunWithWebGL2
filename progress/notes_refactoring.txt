VR
- Need to be able to pass in VR data for left/right view & proj matrix for rendering objects, Need to change viewport
- Renderloop needs a better way to switch main object that calls for frame updates.
- View & Projection Uniform names needs to be global and available for each renderable


SHADERS
- Group objects by shader so possible to render as much with as little repeat steps as possible.
- Replace preRender with beginRender & endRender
- Maybe make GL settings an array, push the ones that needs changing then when done undoes change back to original settings
	Might need to make global default settings for specific gl things.


TRANSFORMATION STACK
- Transform Class will be a base class
- Each transform will have a child list and a parent reference.
- Save transform data as arrays maybe?
- Have setter functions like setPosition(x,y,z) to change the overall values, addPosition(x,y,z) to add/subtract from position.
- Every transform tracks its local transforms, but also up the parent tree to know its world transform.


OTHER
- Parent-Child Transformation Stack
- Maybe think about making a Main Renderer Object??? Instead of shaders


POSSIBLE FUTURE VIDEO IDEAS
- VR : Build RoomScale Box
- VR : Track Vive Controllers, Shoot squares into space
- Cube to Sphere (Great for planet making and smoother skymaps)
- Create King Kai's Planet with nothing but Procedural Generated Meshes (Planet,House,Road,Trees)
- Select and Move objects in 3D Space
- Customizable Splines (Also use them as paths)
- Voxel Chunk
- Particles
- More advanced terrains
- Water
- Simple Physics Engine (Gravity, Velocity (with drag maybe) and Colliders)
- Character Controller (start with controlling a ball on terrain)
- Gamepad Input
- Build a Shader Testing tool like ShaderFrog
- Skeletal Animations (This one will be uber hard but awesome sauce of capable of doing it)
